This lib is a small set of functions for developping 2D/3D animations, transitions 
with models, cameras or sprites.

It's not aimed to be a big popular lib, it just fit my needs for testing my export 
script with Blender (look at my repo called blender-nds-exporter).

To test the current demo with the current binary files:
- just clone the git (or unzip the archive) somewhere
- you just need to have the latest DevkitPro release only
- make sure you have correctly set your DevkitPro environnement (i.e DEVKITPRO and DEVKITARM environnement variables)
- then type 'make' in console at the root 
- and you're good to test the demo in the demo directory.

To test your own exported models, (I assume you have a little bit of C/C++ knowledge) read the source code of the demo and 
modify the name of texture and binary file in "App_Test.cpp" and "data.h".
